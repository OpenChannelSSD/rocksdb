## RocksDB: A Persistent Key-Value Store for Flash, RAM and Open channel SSDs on LightNVM

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/facebook/rocksdb.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/facebook/rocksdb)

RocksDB is developed and maintained by Facebook Database Engineering Team.
It is built on earlier work on LevelDB by Sanjay Ghemawat (sanjay@google.com)
and Jeff Dean (jeff@google.com)

This code is a library that forms the core building block for a fast
key value server, especially suited for storing data on flash drives.
It has a Log-Structured-Merge-Database (LSM) design with flexible tradeoffs
between Write-Amplification-Factor (WAF), Read-Amplification-Factor (RAF)
and Space-Amplification-Factor (SAF). It has multi-threaded compactions,
making it specially suitable for storing multiple terabytes of data in a
single database.

For OCSSD 2 integration, please use the v5.4.6_ocssd_v0.1.7 branch.
